Her blood-red ruby-like tail is incredibly beautiful and appears incredibly similar to a Flameshard, the symbol of the Marching Flame of the Fiery Warpath! Did the Warmonger create the totems for his army in the image of the Huntereater's tail, or is this the source of the Flameshard itself?<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThough precious and beautiful, the tail is extremely venomous and tricks other mice into grabbing at it, believing it to be a simple gemstone.",

Advanced defences make it uncatchable to stay out of hunters' traps, and equally advanced weaponry defends itself against suspicious adversaries.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe perfect mouse... A little TOO perfect.  Once the behavioural modules went live, it became sentient, with the belief that it actually was a unique, wild breed of mouse!  It easily broke free and has avoided all attempts at recapture.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis \"new\" breed is next to impossible to find.   Recent sightings show that it seems to have made some improvements on itself and the M400 has been spotted in multiple regions simultaneously.  Leading us to believe it has some how figured out how to clone itself... What have we done!?",

But now, it seems he has run his last lap of the maze, and has settled down into cozy end-life routines. Donning his fuzzy slippers in his favourite easy chair (which is a giant sack of gold), this retired beast has had his pension paid out in full and has relocated to his secret inner chamber to enjoy his retirement in peace and quiet.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe same shenanigans that used to bring him joy now only cause him grief, and he can be seen shaking his fist from atop his tower at the other mice hustling and bustling in the city. All that noise, all that racket! What a grumpy old grump this once playful beast has become...<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBut even in his twilight and seemingly endless misery, he still manages to let a small grin spread across his lips whenever he causes a mouse to jump in fear at the sound of his snort or the clipping of his hooves.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNo one has broken into his private chambers and lived to tell the tale. Rumor has it that he stores many great and valuable items on opulent displays. Perhaps a resourceful hunter can find a way in and nab one of these rare treasures before being caught!",
