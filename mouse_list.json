Combining years' worth of mouse ethology gathered from the top hunters in Gnawnia, the best and brightest minds out of Digby and the top secret equipment held in Laboratory Room #54 resulted in this: the M400 Prototype.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nDesigned to adapt and camouflage itself as all known breeds of mice, it lives among them in order to analyze and document different mouse behaviours in the wild.  Advanced defences make it uncatchable to stay out of hunters' traps, and equally advanced weaponry defends itself against suspicious adversaries.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe perfect mouse... A little TOO perfect.  Once the behavioural modules went live, it became sentient, with the belief that it actually was a unique, wild breed of mouse!  It easily broke free and has avoided all attempts at recapture.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis \"new\" breed is next to impossible to find.   Recent sightings show that it seems to have made some improvements on itself and the M400 has been spotted in multiple regions simultaneously.  Leading us to believe it has some how figured out how to clone itself... What have we done!?",

        "description": "Thoughtful thieves to the last, Pebble Mice have the innate ability to determine the weight of things. They spend most of their time on the vast mountainside, looking for pebbles of just the right size, shape, and weight. When they encounter a trap, they very carefully use these pebbles to replace the cheese, which fools the trap into thinking that the cheese is still there. Obviously, this tactic garners mixed results, depending on the sophistication of the trap.",

No, you'll have to find some form of charm to attract them during a stampede - perhaps in the shape of their favourite food?<br>\n<br>\nAlthough they're cute now, Grubling Mice that can secure enough food build themselves a charming little cocoon and slowly morph into the far more dangerous Scarab Mouse, so catch as many as you can now to help keep the population in check!",

Hot Head mice had a little too much fun in the sun, and now they're left bright pink, woozy, and more than a little confused. Since melty cheese is sometimes used as a sunscreen, they're storming traps to get some, but they're not in any condition to be walking, let alone stealing.",
